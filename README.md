# personal-portfolio-website

Portfolio Website for Harshil Rajesh Patel.

- The website is made using Next Js and React Js.
- It contains a basic summary of my journey in coding, links to my technical projects, some technologies that I have gained experience with, and ways to contact me.

## Steps to run the website locally:

- Clone this repository and open it in the code editor of your choice (eg. VSCode)
- Create a new terminal or open an existing one, and start the server by running the following command:
- `npm run dev`
- This will build and host the website locally on https://localhost/3000
- Open https://localhost/3000 on the web browser of your choice and you will be able to expore the site by yourself!
